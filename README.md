# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website repository. This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a developer.

## Introduction

Developed a user-friendly web application that provides real-time weather data for any city globally. The app allows users to enter the name of a city and view live weather updates, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy). The app integrates with a weather API to fetch and display accurate data in an easy-to-read format. Focused on clean UI design and responsive functionality to ensure a seamless experience across different devices.
